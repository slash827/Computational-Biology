# Cellular Automata - Global Warming 
The project demonstrates how a world with air pollution is making the earth warmer and eventually making it a living hell. </br>
It was written in Python using Tkinter and Numpy. </br>
In order to run the game you should run the script 'world.py'. </br>

Color meaning are: </br>
>  yellow - city </br>
    brown - land </br>
    blue - ocean </br>
    white - ice </br>
    green - forest </br>

Each generation the following actions occurs simultaneously: </br>
>  The cities produces air pollution which increases their temperature. </br>
>  The pollution spreads nearby and plagues other cells. </br>
>  Ice that its temperature increases above 0 turns into sea (melting). </br>

Eventually all the ices in the world are melting and the world becomes a living nightmare with 50 degrees celsius everywhere (max degree). </br>
  
This is a picture of the world, where each number represents the temperature in that part of the world in the current generation. </br>

After 31 generation the world becomes a living hell, where all the ice has melt.
